# Kernel Headers

A tool to generate and distribute Linux kernel headers for any architectures and kernel versions.
The headers are generated vanilla, and may require further patching for userland usage.

### Supported Architectures

For now, only the following architectures are generated:
* alpha
* arc
* arm
* arm64
* csky
* loongarch
* m68k
* mips
* openrisc
* powerpc
* riscv
* s390
* sh
* sparc
* x86

Other architectures like hexagon, parisc were producing `gcc: error` because
`gcc` is invoked using flags that are only available if it was compiled for
the target architecture.

For now, this project uses a dummy approach of using the host `gcc`, only
the architectures that did not produce a single `gcc: error` as part of their
headers generation were kept.

TODO(cerisier): Support all architectures the right way, using cross compiler when needed.

### Supported Kernel Versions

All versions >= 3.0

> Supporting older kernels requires tweaking how we list supported architectures
> as well as installing a compatible version of gcc.

### Distributed Tarballs

This project distributes headers for the latest patch of each minor kernel version. Previously generated headers are retained, so from the date of this projectâ€™s release onward, this repository will provide headers for all kernel versions.
