# Linux Headers

A tool to generate Linux kernel headers for any architectures and kernel versions.
The headers are generated vanilla, and may require further patching for userland usage.

### Supported Architectures

All architectures available for a given versions are .

### Supported Kernel Versions

All versions >= 3.0

> Supporting older kernels requires tweaking how we list supported architectures
> as well as installing a compatible version of gcc.

### Distributed Tarballs

This project distributes headers for the latest patch of each minor kernel version. Previously generated headers are retained, so from the date of this projectâ€™s release onward, this repository will provide headers for all kernel versions.
